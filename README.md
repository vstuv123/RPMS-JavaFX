 1. Introduction
RPMS (Remote Patient Monitoring System) is a desktop-based healthcare application built using Java and JavaFX. It allows healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely, track their medical reports, assign doctors, and manage appointments or emergencies ‚Äî all through a smart and secure system.

This system is ideal for clinics, hospitals, or health tech startups wanting to digitize patient care workflows. It supports real-time data management, report generation, and communication with patients or staff.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è 5. How to Run the Project
Install Java JDK 21
‚Üí Use the link above and install it like a normal Windows program.

Extract JavaFX SDK
‚Üí Place it anywhere like your Desktop, and remember the folder path.

Add all JAR files
‚Üí Put all the .jar files in a folder called lib. You will add these to your IDE's build path.

Open the project in your IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse).

Go to project settings
‚Üí Add JavaFX SDK and all .jar files to your project dependencies.

Set VM options to run JavaFX properly
Example:

cpp
Copy
Edit
--module-path "path_to_javafx/lib" --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml
Run the main class
This will launch the RPMS interface.

Login as a test user or admin
Credentials are typically set in the database for testing.

Start exploring modules
Add patients, assign doctors, submit reports, or send alerts.
